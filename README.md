# FILE-HANDLING-UTILITY

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: DEVYANI GANGADHAR TAWARE

INTERN ID: CT08JEI

DOMAIN: JAVA PROGRAMMING

BATCH DURATION: JANUARY 20TH, 2025 TO FEBRUARY 20TH, 2025

MENTOR NAME: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

Description of the Code:

The Java program, FileHandlingUtility, demonstrates basic file handling operations, including file creation, writing, reading, and modifying a file. It works with a text file named sample.txt and includes the following functionalities:

1. createAndWriteFile() – Creates the file (if it doesn't exist) and writes some initial text to it.

2. readFile() – Reads and displays the contents of the file.

3. modifyFile() – Appends new text to the existing file.

4. The main() method sequentially calls these functions, ensuring the file is created, read, modified, and read again to verify the changes.

Tools and Editor Used:

Programming Language: Java

Editor Platform: The code can be written and executed in any Java-supported editor, such as:

IntelliJ IDEA

File Handling Tool: The program uses Java's I/O API (java.io.* and java.nio.file.*) for file reading, writing, and modification.

Applications of This Task:

This file handling operation is widely applicable in:

1. Data Storage and Logging: Writing logs, saving configurations, and processing text-based records.

2. Configuration Management: Storing and modifying application settings.

3. Report Generation: Creating and updating reports dynamically.

4. Data Processing: Reading and modifying structured text data (e.g., CSV, JSON).

5. File-based Databases: Small applications that rely on text files instead of databases.

This fundamental concept is useful for desktop applications, backend services, and embedded systems where file handling is needed for data storage and retrieval.
